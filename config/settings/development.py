# hardcoded, so .env.example's DATABASE_URL variable actually does
# something — previously it was documented there but silently ignored,
# which is exactly the kind of "looks configurable but isn't" trap this
# audit exists to catch. Defaults to the same local SQLite file as
# before when DATABASE_URL isn't set, so a fresh clone with no .env
# customisation still works out of the box.

# WAL mode is added on top, only for sqlite3, because the election app
# can have many members hitting the DB with near-simultaneous writes
# (casting votes) during a live vote window — the default SQLite journal
# mode serialises writers far more aggressively than WAL and is the
# single most common cause of "database is locked" errors under that
# exact load pattern. This buys real headroom but is not a substitute
# for moving to PostgreSQL before a large, time-boxed election (see
# ARCHITECTURE.md "Future PostgreSQL migration"). Once DATABASE_URL
# points at postgres://, this block is a no-op — env.db() already
# returned a complete Postgres config and nothing here touches it.
