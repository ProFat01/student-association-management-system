# CRITICAL for PythonAnywhere (and any reverse-proxy deployment): PA
# terminates HTTPS at its own proxy and forwards plain HTTP to this WSGI
# process, setting X-Forwarded-Proto: https on the forwarded request.
# Without telling Django to trust that header, request.is_secure()
# always returns False even for a genuinely HTTPS visitor — which,
# combined with SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True below, produces an *infinite
# redirect loop* (Django thinks every request is HTTP, including the
# ones it just redirected to HTTPS, and redirects again, forever). This
# is the single most common way a correctly-coded Django app fails to
# load at all on PythonAnywhere. See PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md "Reverse
# proxy / HTTPS" for how this was verified.

# include the scheme) or every POST (registration, voting, the contact

# Parsed from DATABASE_URL, same as development.py — see that file's
# comment for why. Defaults to a SQLite file path that can also be set
# directly via DJANGO_DB_PATH (kept as its own variable since on
# PythonAnywhere it's often more convenient to point at a specific
# absolute path than to construct a full sqlite:/// URL by hand). If
# DATABASE_URL is explicitly set to a postgres:// URL, it takes
# precedence and DJANGO_DB_PATH is simply unused.
#
# This is still SQLite v1 for the first deployment — PythonAnywhere's
# free/low tiers don't give you a separate Postgres instance, and SQLite
# is fine for MSA's expected traffic outside of live election windows.
# See ARCHITECTURE.md "Future PostgreSQL migration" for the upgrade path
# and the concrete trigger conditions (concurrent voters, multi-
# association load) that should prompt the switch — at which point
# setting DATABASE_URL=postgres://... in the PythonAnywhere environment
# is the entire migration, no code change required.
