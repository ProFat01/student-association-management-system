Forms for the public voting flow.

Two different jobs, same reasoning behind both: Members don't have User
accounts (registration is admin-mediated, not self-service login — see
apps.members), so "logging in to vote" can't use Django's normal auth.
VotingLoginForm verifies identity against Member fields directly, the
same pattern already used by members.forms.StatusCheckForm for the
status-lookup page.
