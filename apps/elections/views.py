Views for the election management module.

Members don't have User accounts (see apps.members), so "logging in to
vote" is a lightweight, election-scoped session marker rather than
Django's normal authentication — set by voting_login_view after
VotingLoginForm.authenticate() succeeds, checked by _get_voting_member()
before the ballot is ever shown, and cleared once a ballot is submitted.

Django admin login (LOGIN_URL = "admin:login", see config/settings/base.py)
is reused as-is for the one screen that *does* need real auth: the staff
dashboard in PART 9.
