"""
Single source of truth for "what can each role do".

Format: {role_name: ["app_label.codename", ...]}. Using Django's built-in
Permission objects (default add/change/delete/view per model, plus the
custom ones declared in each model's Meta.permissions) instead of a
hand-rolled permissions system means:

  - every ModelAdmin's has_*_permission already understands these for free
  - `user.has_perm(...)` works everywhere, including any future API/views
  - Django's own permission UI (on the Group admin) stays usable for
    fine-tuning without code changes

This module only *declares* the mapping; `setup_roles` (the management
command in management/commands/setup_roles.py) is what actually creates
the Groups and attaches these permissions, and is meant to be re-run
after any change here.

Note: `auth.Group` and `auth.Permission` themselves are deliberately left
out of every role below, including Super Admin. Granting change
permission on Group/Permission to a non-superuser account would let that
account add itself (or anyone) to a more privileged group — i.e. a
privilege-escalation path. Day-to-day "Super Admin" work should be done
through a Django superuser account; the Super Admin *group* exists for
staff who need broad app access without being a true superuser (no
access to Django's own user/permission machinery).
