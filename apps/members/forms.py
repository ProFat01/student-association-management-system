"""
Forms for the public-facing member registration module.

Two forms, two different jobs:
  - MemberRegistrationForm: collects Member fields + a receipt upload,
    does duplicate detection with the exact wording the spec calls for,
    and creates both the Member and its first RegistrationApplication
    together.
  - StatusCheckForm: a plain (non-model) form for the public status
    lookup, supporting either an application number or a NIN+phone pair.
